# Description
This project implements a Neural Style Transfer model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model applies artistic styles from one image (style image) to another (content image) to generate a new image that blends the content and style. It leverages the pre-trained VGG19 model for feature extraction and computes the content and style losses to iteratively optimize the generated image.

# Features
Pre-trained VGG19 Model: Utilizes VGG19 for extracting high-level content and style features. Customizable Weights: Allows users to balance content and style by adjusting the weights. Gram Matrix Calculation: Captures style information effectively by comparing the Gram matrices of feature maps. Configurable Parameters: Supports adjustments to image size, learning rate, and iteration count for fine-tuning results. Image Preprocessing and Reprocessing: Handles input preprocessing and final output reconstruction to ensure compatibility and visual quality.

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git cd neural-style-transfer Install required dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and TensorFlow installed. pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib Place the content and style images: Add your images to the project directory and update the paths in the script: content_image_path: Path to the content image. style_image_path: Path to the style image.

# Usage
Run the script: python neural_style_transfer.py Parameters: iterations: Number of optimization steps (default: 50). content_weight: Weight for content loss (default: 1e3). style_weight: Weight for style loss (default: 1e-2). Output: The generated stylized image will be displayed and saved to the specified location.

# Example
Input Images:
Content Image: A photograph or image with desired content. Style Image: An artistic image whose style you want to apply.

# Output:
The generated image preserves the structure of the content image while applying the artistic style

# Results
The project successfully produces visually appealing stylized images. Here's an example:
